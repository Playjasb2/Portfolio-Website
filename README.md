This is my portfolio website. It was created using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

Site: [www.jasmeetbrar.com](https://www.jasmeetbrar.com/)

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1.  **Clone the repo**

    Clone the repo to your desired location.

    ```shell
    # clone the repo
    git clone https://github.com/Playjasb2/Portfolio-Website.git
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**

    Navigate into the site's directory and install the dependencies.

    ```shell
    cd Portfolio-Website/
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the website locally**

    With the Gatsby CLI installed, you can run the website locally in development mode.

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

4.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying the data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

5.  **Generate optimized build**

    When you're done editing, you can optionally make an optimized build that you can deploy on any server.

    ```shell
    gatsby build
    ```
