Greetings everyone! Welcome to my blog! In this blog, Iâ€™ll be posting about anything that I find remarkable or useful in my life journey. Anything from the abstractions in life to the very specifics in my profession, such as any side projects that Iâ€™m doing and tools that I find useful.

I understand that we are all living in challenging times due to the pandemic. I just graduated from University of Toronto, and right away, this pandemic has affected my opportunities. For the time being, I intend to work on personal projects, and the first project I managed to finish during this pandemic is this website, which has my blog and CV.

In this gloomy time, we must not lose hope. Yes, itâ€™s really sad that we cannot go to our favourite places nor hang out with any of our friends without risking ourselves to the virus. But we can still stay socially connected on the web. With the free time that you may have, you can use the time to learn new skills, workout, and still have fun. I know, that it isnâ€™t easy, but we must not fall into despair. 2020 is a year that we cannot forget, but we can learn a lot from this experience. What fundamentally matters to each one of us. I know that once we are free from the shackles of this pandemic, we will all be more appreciative of the outdoor world.

Starting this blog was a thing I wanted to do right after I made this site. Now that I have done that, I will continue to post more content perhaps on a weekly or monthly basis on what Iâ€™m up to. I hope that some of you may find the blog intriguing, interesting, or at least be of some use to you. I do want to share what Iâ€™ve learned or discovered with all of you.

Thank you for reading my first blog post. I hope to see you all on the other side of this pandemic! Take care! ðŸ™‚
