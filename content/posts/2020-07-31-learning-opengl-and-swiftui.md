This month, there wasnâ€™t much anything too significant that happened in terms of projects. I did explore some frameworks and technologies and see if I can learn anything new. Iâ€™ve been trying to learn OpenGL and SwiftUI.

I started off learning some OpenGL, because I wanted to see how it all works, and maybe I can develop my own game engine. I had been following this [siteâ€™s tutorial](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org) on how to get started with OpenGL, and Iâ€™m currently at tutorial 6, where I had just finished texturing my cube.

Then I went off to exploring the world of app development. I do know that the user interface is the most crucial component to the app. Even if you have the best backend code, if the user interface is badly designed, then the users wonâ€™t use the app. I decided to go learn from Meng Toâ€™s iOS 13 course at [Design+Code](https://designcode.io). I do recommend his course, if you want to learn how to design iOS apps. He also released a course on developing apps for iOS 14, which Iâ€™m going to try out soon. I do plan to make my own app in the future.

I do plan to do more in the future soon. But for now, I have to do quite a lot of learning. ðŸ™‚
